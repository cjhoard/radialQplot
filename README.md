# radialQplot
Sample code for plotting radial discharge plot.
This is a brief example of some R code to plot a radial view of max and min daily discharge at a stream station.  This is based on an example provided by Joshua Kunst for temperature data in his blog (http://jkunst.com/r/how-to-weather-radials/).  The script is named radialQgplot.R and is in this repository.  This example is for streamflow station 04157005 and for the year 2015.  To plot for a different station/timeframe you would need to change line 8 to the station number and dates of your choice.  Note you may need to adjust the timezone code depending on where the stream station is you are interested in.
