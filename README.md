# radialQplot
Sample code for plotting radial discharge plot.
THis is a brief example of some R code to plot a radial view of max and min daily discharge at a stream station.  This is based on an example provided by Joshua Kunst for temperature data in his blog (http://jkunst.com/r/how-to-weather-radials/).
